FAWT Flow Cataloging (Basement, #1) -- May 2019

Streamwise distances used:

- 1.50 -> about 63'' downstream
- 1.25 -> about 52.5'' downstream
- 1.00 -> about 42'' downstream
- 0.75 -> about 31.5'' downstream
- 0.5  -> about 21'' downstream

Remarks:
- All experiments will be by default:
    - 1 min. long
    - control period of 100ms (send a command every such ms)
    - DC offset of 40% for periodics
    - Amplitude of 30% DC for periodics

- All spanwise experiments are done at 0.75 l/x streamwise distance
- Assuming the wind tunnel's side length is 42''

Test-run-specific remarks:
- in CTG9-3 (donut 0-0), the DC offset resets to a lower one at the start (ignore that transient)


Broken test runs (ignore):
- CTG10-7
- CTG10-8

Notation:
- U.P. -> "uniform periodic"
- 150, 125, 100, 075, 050 are downstream distance to fan array length ratios
- Each test run's MkIV CSV file is coupled with a set of ThermalPro logs as:
    ctg_X-Z_*.csv <-> CTGX.Y000Z
    Here X-Z identifies an unique test run and Y is one of R, S, T, V, W
