FAWT Flow Cataloging (Basement, #1) -- May 2019

Remarks:
- All experiments will be by default:
    - 1 min. long
    - control period of 100ms (send a command every such ms)
    - DC offset of 40% for periodics
    - Amplitude of 30% DC for periodics

Notation:
- U.P. -> "uniform periodic"
- 150, 125, 100, 075, 050 are downstream distance to fan array length ratios
- Each test run's MkIV CSV file is coupled with a set of ThermalPro logs as:
    ctg_X-Z_*.csv <-> CTGX.Y000Z
    Here X-Z identifies an unique test run and Y is one of R, S, T, V, W
